	<h1 id='Opinion'>What Travelling Means To Me</h1>
	<p>In my opinion travelling is the best way for someone to move out of their comfort zone and tempts you to encounter life in different ways. For me, travelling is something that is unique as I think there are only so many things we can learn in a school environment. It is so critical to take in every second when travelling and to treasure the experience.</p>

    <h1 id='Recent'>Amsterdam</h1>
    <p>I travelled to Amsterdam in January of this year after saving up enough money from a part-time job. I went to this foreign country with my friends and I must say that the experience was a terrific one. Not only did I notice a massive cultural difference in terms of the general behaviour of the locals to my home country of Ireland but I also fell in love with with the city. The architecture of the buildings were like something out of the Middle Ages and many of the streets still had their cobbles! My friends and I took a bike ride around the city and tasted all of the local delicacies.</p>

    <h2>My Travels</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>I travelled to Wales when I was 10 years old and I did not enjoy the experience. In my opinion, it felt too similar to the lifestyle of Ireland.</li>
        <li>Even from a young age I have been craving a cultural shock to the system and Wales just did not do it for me.</li>
        <li>I travelled to Italy on a school exchange programme when I was in 1st year of secondary school.</li>
        <li>This was a great experience for me as it was my first taste of independence as I was travelling apart from my parents.</li>
        <li>One of my favourite travelling experiences was my trip to Portugal.</li>
        <li>This was my first time feeling the Mediterranean sun on my skin and I loved it.</li>
        <li>I am looking forward to travelling to the U.S.A. when I am older.</li>
        <li>One of my life goals is to travel to every country in the world.</li>
    </ul>
